        <p>My name is Meghan Barcinski and I am currently pursuing a Master of Science in Web Design and Development at the University of Denver. In May of 2020, I graduated from Mays Business School at Texas A&M University with a Bachelor of Business Administration in Marketing focused on Advertising Strategy. I am currently seeking full-time employment in a marketing, content creation, or graphic design role.</p>
        <p>Throughout my time at A&M, I have gotten involved in a variety of organizations and clubs. I was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta, serving on the encouragement and media committees during my time. I was a member and a counselor for the freshman leadership organization, Aggie Fish Club. I also served as the director of media and design for Aggie Miracle. I was a marketing and production specialist for Mays MasterCast podcast as well as a Marketing Student Assistant for the Public Partnership and Outreach Office at Texas A&M.
            I have a passion for design, photography, and videography, and hope to utilize these in my career and my life. I love traveling, being outside, exploring, and spending time with my family, friends, and my dog.</p>
